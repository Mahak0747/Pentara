# 🥷 The Warriors of the Hidden Scroll: PENTARA

> _"The scroll was never meant to be read again..."_

## 🎮 Game Description

Centuries ago, five warriors trained under the same master — a legendary swordsage who guarded 
a hidden scroll: **The Art of the Universe**, a technique said to grant the power to rewrite fate through combat.

The master knew the scroll was too powerful to be used, so he divided its knowledge among 
his five disciples — not on paper, but in their bodies, in their muscle memory, in their scars. 

Each one left with a fragment of the truth, never meant to meet again.

But two of them — now the **opponent Samurai** — betrayed the pact. They believed they could 
recreate the technique together and ascend beyond mortality. 

To do that, they need to defeat the other three and extract what remains of the forgotten art from their souls — through combat.
The remaining **three players** fight not only for survival — But to protect the legacy,
prevent the rebirth of a forbidden power.

They don’t fight for pride.
**They fight because the scroll was never meant to be read again**.
